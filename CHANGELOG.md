# Changelog

Newest first. Dates are IST. "Login" covers how the Kite access token gets from your morning login into the daily job.

## 2026-10-06

### Login (Kite) changes, in order
1. **Client ID fixed.** The Active Kite app had no Zerodha Client ID, so Kite answered "user is not enabled for the app". The field is now `EZQ363`. A partial value (`EZQ36`) had been saved earlier and was corrected.
2. **Redirect URL moved to the relay.** The Kite app's redirect URL points to the Apps Script web app (`/exec`), not to the GitHub Pages `kite.html` page. The Kite login now lands on the relay, which exchanges the one-time `request_token` for the access token.
3. **Relay stores the token.** The relay saves `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `KITE_TOKEN_DATE` in Apps Script's private properties. The token never goes into the public repo or public pages.
4. **Daily job fetches the token from the relay.** Each run calls `?mode=token&key=RELAY_KEY`. If the key doesn't match the relay's `RELAY_KEY`, the relay returns `{"error":"forbidden"}` and the run fails at the token step. This happened in runs #3, #7 and #8 and again in #12, before the key was re-entered.
5. **Relay quote endpoint.** `?mode=quote` returns NIFTY, BANK NIFTY and SENSEX last price, previous close and change. It is public by design and never returns the token. Results are cached for 10 seconds. The phone page reads it on every refresh and falls back to a saved file if the relay is unavailable.
6. **Auto-start after login not working.** The relay tries to start the daily run with `GH_PAT`, but that token lacks **Actions: Read and write**, so it reports "daily run did not start". The 15:45 schedule still runs the job, but GitHub's scheduler has not fired it in practice. Runs so far were started by hand.
7. **Old GitHub-side login still present.** The `kite-login` workflow (paste a token into GitHub) still exists. It is no longer the intended path.
8. **Key exposure.** On 6 Oct, a screenshot of Apps Script's script properties showed the Kite API secret, the GitHub token and the relay key in full. The secrets should be rotated. Rotation is not confirmed.
9. **Key format.** `RELAY_KEY` values containing special characters (such as `$`) were the likely cause of the mismatch. The advice is letters and digits only, typed by hand into both places.

### Hosting and pages
- Phone app moved to a clear dashboard. Desktop shows the three indices side by side with today's estimate in the hero cards. Detail tables stack below.
- Service worker is now network-first, so the phone gets the newest page when online. The cache is only a fallback.
- Pull-to-refresh added. Dragging down from the top reloads forecasts, quotes and F&O.
- Quote label changed from "Live" to "Quotes as of [time]", because the data was not tick-by-tick.
- Cloudflare Pages deployment created at `market-hub-4dq.pages.dev`. It is **not gated yet**.

### Forecasting
- Bank Nifty added: config, live quotes, forecasts, F&O.
- Year-end horizon hidden on the page (the engine still computes it).
- Month-close now shows the range only, with no point call. The backtest showed the month model is no better than the "last close" baseline.
- Today's close estimate added to the feed and the hero card. It is an estimate from the prior close, not a stored pre-open record.

### F&O
- F&O module added (`hub/fno.py`): iron condors and directional spreads for the nearest and monthly expiries, using the forecast bands.
- Fixes after review: same-day expiry skipped, directional calls only on tight bands (≤1.5% half-width), iron condor requires credit ≥10% of wing width and short premiums ≥ ₹5.
- Data-only chain added for an expiry that settles today (±3% of spot, no trade suggestion).

### Daily brief (Gemini)
- Brief module added (`hub/narrate.py`). Model changed from `gemini-2.0-flash` (404) to `gemini-2.5-flash` (404: no longer available to new users) to `gemini-flash-latest`.
- Brief failures no longer stop the job. Retries on 429/503 with backoff.
- Gemini is currently returning 503 (high demand). The page now says "Brief pending" instead of showing the raw error.

## Earlier (summary)
- Forecast engine: six analytical tools, learned weights and bands, backtest, tracking.
- Hosting on GitHub Pages; daily job and manual triggers; feed JSON.
- Kite login via GitHub workflow (`kite-login`) and the `kite.html` redirect page; daily token paste.
